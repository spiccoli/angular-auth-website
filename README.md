# Angular AuthWebsite</br>
This project implements a user authentication system, similar to one I have previously built in PHP  [https://github.com/spiccoli/authWebsite](https://github.com/spiccoli/authWebsite), but this time using the MEAN stack:</br>

MongoDB: Stores user data.</br>
Express.js: Handles HTTP requests and builds the backend API for authentication.</br>
AngularJS: Creates the frontend UI for the sign-up and sign-in forms.</br>
Node.js: Powers the backend and manages interactions with the database.</br></br>
Features:</br></br>
Validation: Both client-side (AngularJS) and server-side (Express.js) validation ensure data integrity.</br></br>
Security: Passwords are hashed for basic protection.</br></br>
Things I would like to add:</br>
sessions/tokens used to manage authentication. JWT KEYS
